# How it works
Type the command
!place x1 y1 x2 y2 seconds

where you specify the coordinates of the top left corner of the grid and bottom right corner as well as the amount of seconds you want to wait for people to opt-in.

Example:
!place 10 10 20 20 60

This will wait for people to opt-in to place pixels in the grid starting at coordinates 10,10 (top left corner) till 20,20 (bottom right corner). It will wait 60 seconds for people to opt in before assigning pixels to them.
